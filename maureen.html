		<h1>ANGELINA MAUREEN ARIYANE</h1>
		<img src="img/pic.jpg">
		<p>I made a promise,
			<b>To distance myself.</b> I took a flight through aurora skies. Honestly, I didn't think about how we didn't say goodbye just see you very soon. It hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing with you. So I didn't call you for sixteen long days, and I should get a cigarette for so much restraint. No matter how long I resist temptation, I will always lose.</p>
			<p><strong>It hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing with you.</strong></p>
		<p>I've done the <i>math,</i> <em><strong>there's no solution.</strong></em> We'll never last. Why can't I let go of this? So, I broke my promise. I called you last night. I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have, if it weren't for the sight of a boy who looked just like you standing out on Melrose Avenue. Lastly, it hurts to be something, it's worst to be nothing with you.</p>

		<p>One day, I will stop falling in love with you. Someday, someone would like me like I like you. Until then, I'll drink my coffee, eat my pie, pretend that we are more than friends. Then, of course I'll let you break my heart again. Someday, one day, I will stop falling in love with you. Until I do, I'll be thinking of you. <strong>I'll let you break my heart again.</strong></p>

		<h2>Is it casual now?</h2>
		<h4>It's fine, it's cool. You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth. I guess I'm the fool with her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof. I don't wanna call it off, but you don't wanna call it love. You only wanna be the one who I call "baby". You could kiss a hundred boys in bars, shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling. You can say it's just the way you are, make a new excuse, another stupid reason. Good luck, babe. Well, good luck babe!</h4>

		<h5>I'm clich√©, who cares? It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair. <a href="#">And I cry, it's not fair</a> I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air. When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night with your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife. And when you think about me, all of those years ago, you're standing face to face with "I told you so". You know I hate to say it, "I told you so". You know I hate to say, but, I told you so.</h5>
